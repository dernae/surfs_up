# surfs_up Module 9 

# Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the location of a surf n' shake class is a viable investment for the given location of Oahu, Hawaii. To do so, a weather analysis is needed in conjunction to the business plan. 


# Results 

- 1,700 June days were analyzed to show that the average temperature of June in Oahu is 74.9 degrees   
  Farenheit. see https://github.com/dernae/surfs_up/blob/master/Resources/junetemps.PNG for more details. 
- 1,517 December days were taken into account. The average temperature of December in Oahu is 71.0 degrees
  Farenheit. see https://github.com/dernae/surfs_up/blob/master/Resources/december%20temps.PNG for more
  details. 
 - The minimum and maximum temperatures for June are 64 degrees Farenheit and 85 degrees Farenheit
   respectively. The minimum and maximum temperatures for December are 56 degrees Farenheit and 83 degrees
   Farenheit respectively. 
   
 # Summary 
 
The data proves that the temperatures in June and December remain around the mild temperature range. It may be a bit concerning to the investors because the temperatures are be slightly too low to be a solid investment. 

In addition to the temperature queries, I would also analyze the occurences of natural disasters(ex. storms, hurricanes or volcanic activity) in Oahu. The tourist activity in Oahu in comparison to other locations in Oahu is another viable query.
